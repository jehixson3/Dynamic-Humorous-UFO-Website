Wake Up Sheeple

A humourous webpage created to display UFO sightings across the globe. 

Greeting the web user is an image of the Earth at night from space and the introduction:
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it!!

After entering site, the web user needs to scroll down to find a table with all of the data from ALIENS-R-REAL.

The information displayed includes the city, state, country, shape of the UFO, and comments based on each individual sighting.  This information can be filtered using the date field to reduce the number of sightings listed in the table on the html page. 

The site is meant to be funny and humorous.  It was created using javascript and D3.
